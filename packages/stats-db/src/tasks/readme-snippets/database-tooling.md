### 📦 Package Management

* [pgpm](https://github.com/constructive-io/constructive/tree/main/pgpm/pgpm): **🖥️ PostgreSQL Package Manager** for modular Postgres development. Works with database workspaces, scaffolding, migrations, seeding, and installing database packages.

### 🧪 Testing

* [pgsql-test](https://github.com/constructive-io/constructive/tree/main/postgres/pgsql-test): **📊 Isolated testing environments** with per-test transaction rollbacks—ideal for integration tests, complex migrations, and RLS simulation.
* [pgsql-seed](https://github.com/constructive-io/constructive/tree/main/postgres/pgsql-seed): **🌱 PostgreSQL seeding utilities** for CSV, JSON, SQL data loading, and pgpm deployment.
* [supabase-test](https://github.com/constructive-io/constructive/tree/main/postgres/supabase-test): **🧪 Supabase-native test harness** preconfigured for the local Supabase stack—per-test rollbacks, JWT/role context helpers, and CI/GitHub Actions ready.
* [graphile-test](https://github.com/constructive-io/constructive/tree/main/graphile/graphile-test): **🔐 Authentication mocking** for Graphile-focused test helpers and emulating row-level security contexts.
* [pg-query-context](https://github.com/constructive-io/constructive/tree/main/postgres/pg-query-context): **🔒 Session context injection** to add session-local context (e.g., `SET LOCAL`) into queries—ideal for setting `role`, `jwt.claims`, and other session settings.

### 🧠 Parsing & AST

* [pgsql-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pgsql-parser): **🔄 SQL conversion engine** that interprets and converts PostgreSQL syntax.
* [libpg-query-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libpg-query): **🌉 Node.js bindings** for `libpg_query`, converting SQL into parse trees.
* [pg-proto-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-proto-parser): **📦 Protobuf parser** for parsing PostgreSQL Protocol Buffers definitions to generate TypeScript interfaces, utility functions, and JSON mappings for enums.
* [@pgsql/enums](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pgsql/enums): **🏷️ TypeScript enums** for PostgreSQL AST for safe and ergonomic parsing logic.
* [@pgsql/types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pgsql/types): **📝 Type definitions** for PostgreSQL AST nodes in TypeScript.
* [@pgsql/utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pgsql/utils): **🛠️ AST utilities** for constructing and transforming PostgreSQL syntax trees.
